### HTML

To start off line 5 in the meta data is so people can view it on smaller devices 

Then line 6 and 7 are for the CSS to be able to reset to any browser if needed and the CSS style sheet

Next lines 11-20 are my header, I have h1 to make my name big, then ive got my 3 page links that I added a # sign before to mark as an id so that I can make the lin work

After that is my sections I made a id selector for the page links to work, then I made the class selector to make changes in CSS. I made two selectors to avoid confusion.

Then in my second section I made I added a link to my Horiseon-Refactor project with the img link, they are both inside the same < a > </ a > making the link interact when you click the picture.

I also made seperate classes for every image, so I can move and style them how I please.

Lastly for my footer I have the i have the selectors so links take me down to them. And the h1 h2 for my contact and info.

### CSS

To start off lines 1 through 6 are some universal rules that made things easier for me starting off

Then I set my body background as white so my entire background is white

Next .navigation is set to change my header and everything inside of it, footer is also placed in with a comma

Lines 12-24 are for my header and footer because i want them to be the same size 

then a has no text decoration so the links are not  underlined then i made them white to look better

.img .Horiseon .place holder and .place holder 2 are for my image size and placement

.what-work-i-have-done was made for getting my media screen to look good 

then all the media screen is made for all screen sizes to look good if viewing on a phone or smaller screen

then i made them change colors to make sure they are working

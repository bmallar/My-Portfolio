HTML

To start off line 5 in the meta data is so people can view it on smaller devices 

Then line 6 and 7 are for the CSS to be able to reset to any browser if needed and the CSS style sheet

Next lines 11-20 are my header, I have h1 to make my name big, then ive got my 3 page links that I added a # sign before to mark as an id so that I can make the lin work

After that is my sections I made a id selector for the page links to work, then I made the class selector to make changes in CSS. I made two selectors to avoid confusion.

Then in my second section I made I added a link to my Horiseon-Refactor project with the img link, they are both inside the same < a > </ a > making the link interact when you click the picture.

I also made seperate classes for every image, so I can move and style them how I please.

Lastly for my footer I have the i have the selectors so links take me down to them. And the h1 h2 for my contact and info.
